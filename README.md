# Starfield-Community-Patch: Vanilla Scripts


This project contains the vanilla papyrus source files of different versions of Starfield.
The main purpose is to make it easier for people to check which scripts got updated, in case one of their mods modifies a vanilla script or its properties in a plugin.
